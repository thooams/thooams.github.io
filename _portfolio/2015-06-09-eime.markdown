## Presentation

Eime is a referential that lets you easily perform your Life Cycle Assessments (LCA)
and your eco-design projects in compliance with international programmes and standards.

## Technology

Eime is develop in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) in his core and in [Extjs](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) for FrontOffice.

### Core programation

Eime has a data versioning in the core application. Mixed with many formulas and a huge database,
Eime allows very little time, thanks to these optimized applications (postgresql),
analyzing the product created by the user in the software in record time.

#### Notification Center

For long operationg:

- .xls export
- .xls import
- analyse export
- design export
- multi copy/cut/paste

Eime allows to launch in the background, time-intensive actions / processes so that the user
can be continued to use the software without any latency.

<br/>
Of course, a percentage display of each action is available in **real time** in the notification center.
And a web notification system (Chrome / Firefox) to be informed of the purpose of the process.

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The technology of the notification center is based on a background job system
([Delayed Job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job)) and a
pubsub system ([Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com/)).
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
One can also find in this notification center, a history of copy / cut / paste to choose one of the last 3 actions in force.

#### Multi copy/cut/paste

This system is used in many places in an application.
Eime is a software including the logic of "container / item", so it is natural
that a simple and effective way to move many projects, folders, boxes study, containers, modules, flow is established.

### Front office

The front office is created dynamically with the Ext JS framework.
This helps create scalable dynamic table but also allows simple
interaction like drag and drop, notifications and real-time search
or interface component displacement. All thanks to the MVC pattern.

#### Analysis/graphs/calculation Interface

The analysis part comprises two distinct parts:

* the table of values
* the graphics

Some calculations are created and optimized with requests for optimal performance gain.
A tab management was created in order to compare the results of calculations.

<br/>
<br/>

The graphs show the previous values in the operator to provide the most appropriate chart (pie, bar, column ...).
You can refine the results of graphics in real time and also set these last through the 3D or changing scales.
<br/>

<br/>

#### Design Interface

The design part includes several distinct elements:

* Tab
* Tree
* Overview
* Breadcrumb
* Database

A case study contains phases, these phases are represented by a tab system.
In this tab, there is a tree on the left, an overview with a search engine,
an interactive breadcrumb and information panels.

<br/>
The database with integrated search engine includes an information panel.

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Each element inserted in the overview includes rights and everyone is different depending on where it is located.
Visual information are shown in real time, or if we can not do this or that action.

<br/>
The copy / cut / paste is also part tt a window opens indicating in real time (as in modern OS)
the progress of the current action.

#### Project Interface

The project part have a project tree on the left, an overview of the center and a
retail panel on the right. The copy / cut / paste into this and right click actions are implemented.

<br/>

### Main Search (spotlight)

The main research is a kind of spotlight (Apple) and allows you to search
any information in the application through a search window.

#### And After

Other interfaces (database, administration, project manager)
are under development and will features and existing visual on other interfaces.

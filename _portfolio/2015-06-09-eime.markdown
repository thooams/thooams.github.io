## Presentation

Eime is a referential that allows you easily perform your Life Cycle Assessments (LCA)
and your eco-design projects in accordance with international programmes and standards.

## Technology

Eime is developped in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) in his core and in [Extjs](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) for FrontOffice.

### Core programation

Eime has a data versioning in the core application. Mixed with many formulas and a huge database,
Eime allows very little time, thanks to these optimized applications (postgresql),
analyzing the product created by the user in the software in record time.

#### Notification Center

For long operationg:

- .xls export
- .xls import
- analyse export
- design export
- multi copy/cut/paste

Eime will launch in the background intensive action in time and process so the user can continue to browse without any latency.

<br/>
Of course, a percentage display of each action is available in real time in the notification center.
In addition, a web notification system (Chrome / Firefox) allows to be informed of the purpose of the process.

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The technology of the notification center is based on a background job system
([Delayed Job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job)) and a
pubsub system ([Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com/)).
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The notification center provides a historical of copy / cut / paste to choose one of the last 3 actions in force

#### Multi copy/cut/paste

The system of multi copy / cut / paste is used in several interfaces within the application.
Eime is a software including the logic of "container / item", so it is natural that a simple and
effective method is implemented to move many projects, folders, boxes study, containers, modules flows.

### Front office

The front office is created dynamically with the Ext JS framework.
This allows dynamic arrays created modular but also allows simple
interactions like drag and drop,notifications and real-time search
or interface component displacement. All thanks to the MVC pattern.
Everything is tested with [selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/).

#### Analysis/graphs/calculation Interface

The analysis part include two distinct parts:

* Table of values
* Gaphics

Some calculations are optimized through database queries to a performance gain.
A tab management was created in order to compare the results of calculations.

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

Graphics exploit previous values to offer the most appropriate chart (pie, bar, column ...).
It is possible to refine the results of graphics in real time and also to set these through the 3d or changing scales.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

#### Design Interface

The design part includes several distinct elements:

* Tab
* Tree
* Overview
* Breadcrumb
* Database

A case study contains phases represented by a tab system. These tabs contain a tree on the left,
an overview with a search engine, an interactive breadcrumb and information panels.

<br/>
The database with integrated search engine includes an information panel.

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Each element inserted in the overview includes all different rights depending on where the item is located.
Visual information just indicate in real time if the insertion is possible to achieve.

<br/>
The copy / cut / paste is also present. A window opens indicating
in real time (as in modern OS) the progress of the current action.

#### Project Interface

The Project part provides a project tree on the left, an overview at the center and a retail panel on the right.
The copy / cut / paste is also active well as the right click allowing more actions.

<br/>

### Main Search (spotlight)

The Main research is a kind of spotlight (spotlight apple) and allows
to find any information in the application through a search window.

<br/>

#### And After

Other interfaces (database, administration, project manager) are under
development and will take the functionalities already present in the existing interfaces.

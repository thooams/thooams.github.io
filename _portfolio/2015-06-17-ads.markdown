## Presentation

**Ui bibz** is an interface framework for building an interface very quickly and simply using
[Ruby on Rails 4](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [Boostrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)

## Technical

Ui bibz is a gem for Ruby on Rails easy to use and create components with a single basic element: ```Component```.
<br/>
![dropdown]({{ site.url }}/images/portfolio/ui-bibz/button_split_dropdown.png)
<br/>
<br/>

Creating components in Ruby allows not having to write HTML code for **Bootstrap elements***.
And therefore do not have to update all the HTML and CSS when updates to Boostrap

<br/>

![Table]({{ site.url }}/images/portfolio/ui-bibz/table.png)
<br/>
<br/>

Ui bibz is fully **tested, documented and extensible***.
Some complex components like tables with their search, their pagination and their internalization is already part of the framework.
Many components are coming in later versions.

## And After

This library is open source (MIT), available at: [Ui-Bibz]({{ site.url }}/Ui-Bibz/)
It was created and is maintained by yours truly.
